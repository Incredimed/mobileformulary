    <h1>About Open BNF</h1>
    <p>
        Open BNF was built as an exploratory research project at the <a href="http://nhshackday.com/">NHS Hackday</a> to explore better ways of providing Doctors with access to drug dosage information via their mobile phones whilst they are working on wards.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was built by a group of doctors and developers who gave up their weekend and to try and make the NHS run a bit smoother.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this is a research project it should <strong>not be used in real medical situations</strong>, <a href="http://www.bnf.org/">BNF.org</a> remains the definitive source, and the copyright of the data remains theirs.

    <h2>Will this become a fully working app?</h2>
    <p>We certainly hope so. We will be talking to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain about securing a license and regular updates to the data.</p>
